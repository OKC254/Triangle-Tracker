        <p>They are three main types of triangles:</p>
          <div class = "list">
            <li>Equilateral Triangle</li>
          </div>
              <p>This triangle’s name indicates that its three sides are equal in length. In equilateral triangles, all three angles are equal; each has the same measurement. If we divide 180º by the triangle’s number of sides to determine the three angles’ measurements, we will get 60º.  Each of the equilateral triangle’s three angles measure 60º.</p>

          <div class = "list">
            <li>Isoceles
          </div>
              <p>Isosceles triangles have two equal angles and one that is different. This makes the triangles have two equal sides and one different side as well. The side that is different is located precisely between the equal angles.</p>

          <div class = "list">
            <li>Scalene Triangle</li>
          </div>
               <p>This triangle is the opposite of the equilateral triangle. In scalene triangles, all of the angles are different; each one has a different measurement. This characteristic makes each of the triangle’s three sides have different measurements.</p>
