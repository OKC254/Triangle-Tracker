#### Description
The following program is designed to interface with the user such that the program prompt or rather the user is provided the option to input the various lengths of the possible triangle and return a relevant answer as well as provide the user with additional information about the triangle in question denoting its properties.

Based on the functionality of the application, key points are;

For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
For an isosceles triangle, two sides must be equal.
For a scalene triangle, no side must be equal. However, the sumof two side must be more than than the length of the third side.
Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the length of the third side, then a triangle cannot be formed. (For example 2, 2 and 6 cannot form a triangle nor can 3, 4 and 9)
